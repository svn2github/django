Django 1.5 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

These release notes cover the `new features`_, as well
as some `backwards incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of
when upgrading from Django 1.4 or older versions. We've also dropped some
features, which are detailed in :doc:`our deprecation plan
</internals/deprecation>`, and we've `begun the deprecation process for some
features`_.

.. _`backwards incompatible changes`: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.5`_
.. _`begun the deprecation process for some features`: `Features deprecated in 1.5`_

Python compatibility
====================

Django 1.5 has dropped support for Python 2.5. Python 2.6 is now the minimum
required Python version. Django is tested and supported on Python 2.6 and
2.7.

This change should affect only a small number of Django users, as most
operating-system vendors today are shipping Python 2.6 or newer as their default
version. If you're still using Python 2.5, however, you'll need to stick to
Django 1.4 until you can upgrade. Per :doc:`our support policy
</internals/release-process>`, Django 1.4 will continue to receive security
support until the release of Django 1.6.

As Jython does currently not offer any version compatible with Python 2.6,
Django 1.5 does not run on Jython.
