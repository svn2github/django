Backwards incompatible changes in 1.4
=====================================

Compatibility with old signed data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django 1.3 changed the cryptographic signing mechanisms used in a number of
places in Django. While Django 1.3 kept fallbacks that would accept hashes
produced by the previous methods, these fallbacks are removed in Django 1.4.

So, if you upgrade to Django 1.4 directly from 1.2 or earlier, you may
lose/invalidate certain pieces of data that have been cryptographically signed
using an old method. To avoid this, use Django 1.3 first, for a period of time,
to allow the signed data to expire naturally. The affected parts are detailed
below, with 1) the consequences of ignoring this advice and 2) the amount of
time you need to run Django 1.3 for the data to expire or become irrelevant.

* contrib.sessions data integrity check

  * consequences: the user will be logged out, and session data will be lost.

  * time period: defined by SESSION_COOKIE_AGE.

* contrib.auth password reset hash

  * consequences: password reset links from before the upgrade will not work.

  * time period: defined by PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS.

Form related hashes â€” these are much shorter lifetime, and are relevant only for
the short window where a user might fill in a form generated by the pre-upgrade
Django instance, and try to submit it to the upgraded Django instance:

* contrib.comments form security hash

  * consequences: the user will see a validation error "Security hash failed".

  * time period: the amount of time you expect users to take filling out comment
    forms.

* FormWizard security hash

  * consequences: the user will see an error about the form having expired,
    and will be sent back to the first page of the wizard, losing the data
    they have inputted so far.

  * time period: the amount of time you expect users to take filling out the
    affected forms.

* CSRF check

  * Note: This is actually a Django 1.1 fallback, not Django 1.2,
    and applies only if you are upgrading from 1.1.

  * consequences: the user will see a 403 error with any CSRF protected POST
    form.

  * time period: the amount of time you expect user to take filling out
    such forms.
